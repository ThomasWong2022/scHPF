Single-cell Hierarchical Poisson Factorization
==============================================

Single-cell Hierarchical Poisson Factorization (scHPF) is a tool for *de novo* discovery 
of discrete and continuous expression patterns in single-cell RNA\-sequencing 
(scRNA-seq). 

We find that scHPFâ€™s sparse low-dimensional representations, non-negativity, 
and explicit modeling of variable sparsity across genes and cells produces highly interpretable 
factors.  The algorithm takes genome-wide molecular counts as input, avoids prior normalization, 
and has fast, memory-efficient inference on sparse scRNA-seq datasets. 

Algorithmic details, benchmarking against alternative methods, and scHPF's 
application to a spatially sampled high-grade glioma can be found in `our paper at Molecular Systems Biology`_.
