Single-cell Hierarchical Poisson Factorization
==============================================

Single-cell Hierarchical Poisson Factorization (scHPF) is a tool for *de novo*
discovery of discrete and continuous expression patterns in single-cell
RNA\-sequencing (scRNA-seq). 

We find that scHPFâ€™s sparse low-dimensional representations, non-negativity,
and explicit modeling of variable sparsity across genes and cells produces
highly interpretable factors.  The algorithm takes genome-wide molecular counts
as input, avoids prior normalization, and has fast, memory-efficient inference
on sparse scRNA-seq datasets. 

Algorithmic details, benchmarking against alternative methods, and scHPF's
application to a spatially sampled high-grade glioma can be found in 
[Levitin2019]_.


You can find the software `on github <https://www.https://github.com/simslab/scHPF>`_.
