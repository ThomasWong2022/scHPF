# Single-cell Hierarchical Poisson Factorization

## About
scHPF is a tool for _de novo_ discovery of both discrete and continuous expression patterns in single-cell RNA\-sequencing (scRNA-seq). We find that scHPFâ€™s sparse low-dimensional representations, non-negativity, and explicit modeling of variable sparsity across genes and cells produce highly interpretable factors.

Algorithmic details, benchmarking against alternative methods, and scHPF's application to a spatially sampled high-grade glioma can be found in our [paper at Molecular Systems Biology](http://msb.embopress.org/content/15/2/e8557.full.pdf).

##  Installation
### Environment & Dependencies
scHPF requires Python >= 3.6 and the packages:
- numba <=0.40, >=0.35 (numba 0.41 reduces scHPF's performance...on TODO list to resolve)
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- (optional) loompy


The easiest way to setup a python environment for scHPF is with [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
```
conda create -n schpf_p37 python=3.7 scikit-learn numba=0.40 pandas

# older anaconda
source activate schpf_p37
# XOR newer anaconda
conda activate schpf_p37

# Optional, for using loom files as input to preprocessing
pip install -U loompy
```
### Installing from source
Once you have set up the environment, clone this repository and install.
```
git clone git@github.com:simslab/scHPF.git
cd scHPF
pip install .
```

## scHPF Command Line Interface (CLI) Quickstart

1. [Prepare your data](https://schpf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prep-cli.html). 

2. [Train a model](https://schpf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/train-cli.html).

3. [Get gene and cell scores with the CLI](https://schpf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/score-cli.html)


## scHPF API

scHPF has a scikit-learn like API. Trained models are stored in a serialized
joblib format.
